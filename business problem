Projects – The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1) Assignment:

Business Problem:
An investor is looking to open a new restaurant in San Francisco, but he is not sure about the best location for his new venue. So you got a call from him asking your input to help him choose the location. San Francisco is a very busy city, best known for tourist attractions and business innovation. Strolling around the city blocks, it pretty easy to notice that the city already has a lot of restaurants in town. How should we proceed and decide the location?
In The Art of War, Sun Tzu has said: “Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril.” Following this line of thinking, the basic strategy here is then to know what are the most critical factors that contribute to the restaurant’s profitability. According to a report written by Tom Larkin published in the FSR magazine, these components stand out as the most important ones: visibility, parking, space size, crime rates, surrounding businesses and competitor analysis, accessibility, affordability, and safety. Using public datasets, we could actually address some of these considerations pretty straightforwardly.
